# Midnight Owl

This is an adaption of Sarah Drasner's awesome [Night Owl VSCode theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl&WT.mc_id=twitter-social-sdras) for Atom. Even though it's a syntax theme, it also applies some styles to the UI. It's
recommended you use [Seti UI](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui) in compact mode.
